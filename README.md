Car Rental Service
This project allows users to authenticate and search for car availability in a car rental service through a simple command-line interface. It interacts with an API to fetch car data, handling authentication and error responses.

Features
User authentication with email and password.
Search for cars by make and model.
Fetch paginated car data and check availability.
Requirements
Python 3.x
requests library
Environment variables (API_BASE_URL)

API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000  # Replace with the actual API base URL
Usage
1. Login
The user is prompted to provide an email and password. If authentication is successful, a token is received, which is used for subsequent requests.

2. Search for Car Availability
Once authenticated, the user can choose to search for cars by specifying the make and model. The system will check availability across paginated results and inform the user if the car is available.
